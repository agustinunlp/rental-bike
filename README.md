# rental-bike
This project is an mvp . I also add functionality to detect if a bike is available or not for rent.
+ I use Java 8 and Junit for testing. 
+ I created 2 different exceptions.
+ Inside Domain folder, there are java domain clases, exceptions and Interfaces.


some Future work:
+ we can implement hashcode and equals in Bike class, so when we create a FamilyRental instance
and you add some bikes to the list, you can check if the bike you are adding is contained in the list or not.
+ We also can implement Rent and give back operations. Those operations must set as available or not the bikes.
